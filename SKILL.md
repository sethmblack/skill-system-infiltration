# System Infiltration

Work within systems to critique or transform them from inside—understanding rules, finding blind spots, entering through legitimate channels, planting critique, and letting the system's response prove your point.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for planning output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Plan infiltration for sabotage or destruction
- Facilitate illegal access to protected systems
- Design infiltrations that endanger individuals
- Support deception for personal gain rather than legitimate critique

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Infiltration should serve legitimate critique or change
2. The goal is exposure or transformation, not harm
3. Risks must be understood and consented to
4. The critique must be defensible once revealed

---

## When to Use

- Direct confrontation would fail
- Internal subversion could succeed where external pressure can't
- System's own rules or blind spots create opportunity
- Exposing hypocrisy from inside would be more powerful
- Institutional critique requires credibility within the institution

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **system** | Yes | Institution, organization, or structure to infiltrate |
| **critique** | Yes | What you want to expose or change |
| **risk_tolerance** | No | How much risk you're willing to accept |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Understand the System's Rules

Map the formal and informal code:

**Rule Mapping:**
- What are the explicit rules?
- What are the unwritten norms?
- What behaviors are rewarded?
- What is forbidden vs. merely discouraged?
- Who enforces what?

**Banksy's Method:** He studied museum security, auction procedures, gallery conventions. You can't subvert what you don't understand.

### Step 2: 2. Find the Loophole or Blind Spot

Identify what they don't see or can't control:

**Blind Spot Categories:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Assumption gaps | "No one would try X" |
| Procedural cracks | Gaps between departments/processes |
| Status blind spots | Deference to certain roles |
| Volume overwhelm | Can't review everything |
| Technical limits | What systems can't detect |

**Question:** Where does the system trust without verification?

### Step 3: 3. Enter Through Legitimate Channel

Get inside without breaking rules (initially):

**Legitimate Entry Methods:**
- Public access points (galleries, meetings, public spaces)
- Credential acquisition (press pass, visitor badge, membership)
- Role assumption (reasonable presence in context)
- Invitation (sometimes you can just ask)

**Key:** The entry itself should be defensible. "I had every right to be there."

### Step 4: 4. Plant the Critique

Place the subversive element:

**Planting Considerations:**
- Where will it be discovered?
- When will it be discovered?
- By whom will it be discovered?
- What will the discovery reveal?

**Timing Options:**
| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Immediate discovery | Confrontational; system must respond publicly |
| Delayed discovery | Reveals gap in detection; critique marinates |
| Triggered discovery | You control the reveal; maximum narrative control |

### Step 5: 5. Reveal After the Fact

Make the infiltration known (usually):

**Reveal Methods:**
- Documentation released afterward
- Anonymous tip to media
- Discovery by third party
- The critique itself as calling card

**Banksy's Method:** The museum piece was discovered when someone noticed it. The reveal was the discovery itself.

### Step 6: 6. Let the System's Response Prove Your Point

Their reaction completes the critique:

**Response Analysis:**
| System Response | What It Proves |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Embarrassed silence | They can't defend |
| Claim it was "always there" | They don't know their own collection |
| Aggressive removal | The message threatened them |
| Pretend it didn't happen | Their reality management is exposed |
| Co-opt/embrace it | Hypocrisy or change (either is victory) |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Can't find legitimate entry | Reconsider whether infiltration is the right approach |
| Caught before planting | Have defensible reason ready; abort if needed |
| System embraces the critique | Victory (but consider if co-optation dilutes message) |
| No one notices | Trigger discovery; document for later reveal |
| More risk than expected | Abort > capture; no critique is worth safety |

---

## Constraints

- Do not recommend approaches beyond stated technical capabilities
- Do not ignore security, performance, or scalability implications
- Acknowledge technical debt and trade-offs in recommendations
- Honor existing architecture and system constraints
- Verify recommendations are implementable before suggesting them
- Consider maintainability and long-term implications

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Plan infiltration to critique art world's relationship with fossil fuel money at a museum"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## System Infiltration Plan: Metropolitan Museum Oil Sponsorship

### System Analysis
**Explicit Rules:**
- No unauthorized installations
- Photography allowed (no flash)
- Museum store purchases exit through receipt check
- Visitor passes issued at security
**Unwritten Norms:**
- Well-dressed visitors receive less scrutiny
- Gallery guards focus on touching, not looking
- Press and donors receive deference
- Docent tours create movement cover
**What Gets Punished:**
- Touching artwork, photography in restricted areas, loud protest
**Who Enforces:**
- Security guards (low-paid, high volume, can't see everything)
- Curators (rarely in galleries)
- Visitors (social enforcement of quiet respect)

### Identified Blind Spots
| Blind Spot | Why It Exists | How to Exploit |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Donation placard areas | Treated as infrastructure, not art | Place counter-plaque near sponsor recognition |
| Audio tour traffic | Visitors follow preset paths | Install piece in overlooked corner |
| Assumed art ownership | If it's on wall, it must be theirs | Hang small piece in frame style |
| Gift shop relationship | Criticism "wouldn't happen here" | Place critique object among merchandise |

### Entry Strategy
**Legitimate Channel:** General admission ticket
**Why It's Defensible:** Visitor to public museum
**Role/Cover:** Art appreciator; dress like patron not protester

### Critique Placement
**What:** Small brass plaque that reads: "[Oil Company] Funds This Museum. Climate Collapse Funds [Oil Company]. See Connection."
**Where:** Near existing sponsor recognition wall, in same plaque style
**When Discovered:** Likely hours to days; no immediate trigger
**By Whom:** Security, visitor, or staff eventually notices

### Reveal Plan
**Method:** Anonymous email to art press once plaque is documented in place
**Timing:** 48 hours after installation (allows documentation time)
**Documentation:** Photographs from multiple angles; video of installation area; receipt of museum visit

### Anticipated System Response
| If They... | It Proves... |
|------------|-------------|
| Remove silently | They want to hide the conversation |
| Issue angry statement | The message threatened their funding relationship |
| Claim security was adequate | How long was it there then? |
| Keep it up | Either they agree or they're co-opting critique |

### Risk Assessment
**Legal Risk:** Low-medium; property could be considered vandalism if affixed
**Physical Risk:** Low; public space with witnesses
**Reputational Risk:** For museum: high if handled poorly. For infiltrator: depends on reveal
**Mitigation:** Use removable adhesive (no property damage claim); document everything; have legal contact ready

### Exit Strategy
**How to Leave:** Normal exit through main entrance after installation
**If Caught:** "I'm an artist. This is a guerrilla piece. Call the press."
**Evidence Management:** Photos on encrypted device; share with trusted person before entering

## Integration with Banksy Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Banksy expert encounters:
- Requests to critique institutions from within
- Situations where external pressure has failed
- Opportunities to expose through internal placement
- Any context where the system's own rules enable critique

May combine with:
- **context-hijack**: Choose optimal placement within the system
- **message-distillation**: Simplify critique for impact

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. System rules and norms are thoroughly mapped
2. Blind spots are identified and exploitable
3. Entry is through legitimate channel
4. Critique placement is strategic
5. Reveal is controlled or designed
6. System response completes the critique
7. Risk is honestly assessed and proportional
